description: Generate simple, focused questions from single context chunks
---

## Overview

Single-hop specific synthesizers generate simple, focused questions that can be answered from a single context chunk. These are ideal for testing basic retrieval and factual accuracy in RAG systems.

## Creating the Synthesizer

```typescript
import { createSynthesizer } from '@open-evals/generator'
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai'

const synthesizer = createSynthesizer(
  openai.chat('gpt-4o'),
  'single-hop-specific'
)

// Use in synthesis
const samples = await synthesize({
  graph: knowledgeGraph,
  synthesizers: [[synthesizer, 100]], // 100% of samples
  personas,
  count: 100,
})
```

### Parameters

import { TypeTable } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/type-table';

<TypeTable
  type={{
    model: {
      description: 'The language model to use for generating questions and answers',
      type: 'LanguageModel',
      required: true,
    },
    type: {
      description: 'The type of synthesizer to create',
      type: "'single-hop-specific'",
      required: true,
    },
  }}
/>

## Generated Questions

Single-hop specific questions are:

**Factual and Direct** - Clear, unambiguous questions with specific answers

**Single-Source** - Answerable from one context chunk

**Specific** - Target particular concepts, features, or details

Example questions generated:

```typescript
// TypeScript documentation
'What is the syntax for optional properties in TypeScript?'
'How do you declare a string array in TypeScript?'
'What does the readonly modifier do in TypeScript?'

// API documentation
'What HTTP method does the /users endpoint accept?'
'What is the rate limit for the search API?'
'What format does the API return error messages in?'
```

## When to Use

Single-hop specific synthesizers are ideal for:

**Baseline Testing** - Establish minimum retrieval quality for your RAG system

**Factual Accuracy** - Test if your system can retrieve and return specific facts correctly

**Knowledge Coverage** - Verify all key concepts in your knowledge base are accessible

**Quick Iterations** - Fast to generate and evaluate, good for development

## Characteristics

### Complexity

- **Low** - Straightforward questions with direct answers
- **Single Context** - Only one chunk needed to answer
- **Clear Intent** - No ambiguity about what's being asked

### Testing Focus

- **Retrieval** - Does your system find the right chunk?
- **Accuracy** - Does your system extract the correct information?
- **Precision** - Does your system answer without hallucination?

## Sample Output

```typescript
{
  query: "What is the syntax for optional properties in TypeScript?",
  reference: "Optional properties in TypeScript use the ? modifier after the property name. For example: `interface User { name: string; age?: number; }` makes age optional.",
  retrievedContexts: [
    "TypeScript provides several ways to mark properties as optional. The ? modifier after a property name indicates it may be undefined..."
  ],
  metadata: {
    persona: "Junior Developer",
    queryType: "specific",
    queryLength: "medium",
    queryStyle: "conversational"
  }
}
```
