description: Build and transform structured knowledge representations

## Overview

The knowledge graph is the foundation of test data generation. It's a structured representation of your domain knowledge with nodes (documents and chunks) and relationships (connections between concepts).

Unlike raw text, a knowledge graph enables:

- Semantic search through embeddings
- Multi-hop reasoning across related chunks
- Understanding of document structure and relationships
- Efficient retrieval for test generation

## Creating a Knowledge Graph

Start with document nodes representing your source content:

```typescript
import { graph, DocumentNode } from '@open-evals/generator'

const documents = [
  new DocumentNode(
    'typescript-basics.md', // Unique identifier
    'TypeScript is a typed...', // Content
    { category: 'tutorial' } // Custom metadata
  ),
  new DocumentNode('advanced-types.md', 'Advanced TypeScript features...', {
    category: 'reference',
  }),
]

const knowledgeGraph = graph(documents)
```

At this point, your graph contains only document nodes. You'll enrich it with transforms.

## Transform Pipeline

Transforms are composable functions that enrich your graph. Chain them together to build sophisticated knowledge representations:

```typescript
import {
  transform,
  chunk,
  embed,
  relationship,
  summarize,
} from '@open-evals/generator'
import { RecursiveCharacterSplitter } from '@open-evals/rag'
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai'

const enrichedGraph = await transform(graph(documents))
  .pipe(summarize(openai.chat('gpt-4o')))
  .pipe(chunk(new RecursiveCharacterSplitter({ chunkSize: 512 })))
  .pipe(embed(openai.embedding('text-embedding-3-small')))
  .pipe(relationship())
  .apply()
```

Each transform runs sequentially, building on the previous step's output.
